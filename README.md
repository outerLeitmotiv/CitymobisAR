CitymobisAR Project
Overview

Citymobis is an innovative app aimed at boosting citizenship involvement in local communities and institutions. The project is currently in the development phase, focusing on integrating the SceneView API for augmented reality (AR) functionalities.
Current Status

    Permissions and Camera Access: The app is currently able to request permission to access the camera and successfully open it. This is a foundational step in our journey to fully implement AR features.

    SceneView API Integration Issues: We are experiencing challenges with the implementation of the SceneView API. These issues are actively being addressed, with the goal to utilize AR for displaying interactive 3D models in the user's environment.

Objective

Our goal is to enable users to visualize future city projects and constructions in AR, providing a unique perspective on how these developments will integrate into their neighborhoods.
Development

    Language and Frameworks: The app is being developed using Kotlin and integrates SceneView for AR capabilities.
    Permissions: Current implementation includes necessary permission handling for camera usage.

Next Steps

    Resolve existing issues with SceneView API integration.
    Implement functionalities to load and display 3D models in AR.
    Test and optimize AR interactions and model rendering.
    Add Firebase integration for user authentication and data storage.
